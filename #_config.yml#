user_description: I'm a Software Engineer from Argentina, always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been immersed in world of Giving Circles working with Grapevine, a California based startup trying to improve the world through collaborative giving. I'm the first engineer they hired to work on the platform.
