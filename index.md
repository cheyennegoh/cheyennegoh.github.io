## Skills
Majority of the classes I've taken in university were conducted in either Java or C/C++. I also have a practical understanding of front-end web development using ReactJS from collaborative term projects.

During the summer of 2021, I worked a summer student position at Flexcim Services Inc., a small manufacturing company that specialises in injection moulding and CNC machining. I gained experience writing software in Python to manage MySQL databases and programming PLCs using ladder logic.

From May 2022 to August 2023, I did a software internship at AMD. I contributed to [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT)/[hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipFFT), an open-source library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms on AMD and Nvidia GPU devices. I developed skills in GPU programming using C++, as well as prototyping and performance testing using Python.

In total, I have set foot in 32 countries over five continents. I've visited Australia, Austria, The Bahamas, Belgium, Belize, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, France, Greece, the Holy See (Vatican), Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I have passed through Germany, the ROC (Taiwan), and the United Arab Emirates on layovers as well.

I will be moving to Ireland in June 2024 to study at the University of Limerick. 

## Interests

### Video Games

>***"I've never seen someone so bad at video games before---I didn't know it was possible!"*** -- A friend watching me try to play *The Stanley Parable*.

I enjoy playing video games even though I am objectively not very good at them. My proudest accomplishment has been sucessfully mapping my Logitech Driving Force GT racing wheel to Goat Simulator controls so I could drive the goat. My all-time favourite video games include Persona 4 Golden, Overwatch 2, GRID Autosport, Mario Kart 7, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Pok√©mon Ruby, Tetris, KeyWe, and A Little to the Left.

**PC:** AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, AMD Ryzen 5 5600, 32 GB RAM

### Photography

![Toy Camera](/assets/images/toycamera.jpg)

My photography journey began in 2007, when I received a pink toy camera from my godmother for Christmas. Not long after receiving it, I dropped it and broke it. Sadly, this will not be the last camera of mine to suffer this cruel fate.

A few years later, I bought a black Sony Cyber-shot camera from the local Walmart. It was the first major (over CA$100!) purchase I'd ever made. Unfortunately, it fell off my lap and smashed against a tile floor during a family vacation to Florida, USA in 2011.

Shortly after this, my dad got me an updated Sony Cyber-shot camera as a Christmas gift. The death of this camera was the most theatrical and tragic of all. It was a rainy day in New York City, USA. I was exploring the city with my brother, dad, and uncle. We were walking through Times Square when I saw a massive puddle. Naturally, I had the urge to jump over it. As I was jumping, the camera fell out of my pocket and into the puddle. I grabbed it out as quickly as I could, but it was too late. Slowly, the water seeped through its components. It took its last photograph in the American Museum of Natural History before drawing its last breath in my clumsy arms.

Despite my terrible track record, my passion for photography never died. These days, I shoot with a Olympus E-PL3 micro four-thirds digital camera and an Olympus OM-1n film camera. I love using them to capture memories of different people, places, and things. Thankfully, both these cameras have survived to this day.

### Bouldering

I started indoor bouldering recently and I've been enjoying it a lot. It's been an awesome way to get moving while also hanging out with friends. I love crimps and hate slopers.

### Coaching

I am currently an assistant coach for the Calgary Speed Skating Association. I coach the youngest group of skaters, aged 10 and under, on both short and long track. I am always  impressed by how quickly they learn and improve.
