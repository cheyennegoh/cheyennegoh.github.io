## Skills
Majority of my university courses were conducted in either Java or C/C++. I also have front-end web development experience in ReactJS from collaborative class projects. At my summer student position, I programmed primarily in Python. My industry experience includes writing software to manage MySQL databases and programming PLCs using ladder logic. I am proficient with graphic design software, including Adobe Photoshop and Inkscape, as well.

## Travel

Since moving from Singapore to Canada in 2003, I have been to six provinces across the country (Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan). I have also been able to return to Singapore fairly frequently over the years. In total, I have set foot in 29 countries over five continents. I've visited Australia, Austria, The Bahamas, Belgium, Belize, Bulgaria, China, France, the Holy See (Vatican), Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I have passed through Germany, the ROC (Taiwan), and the United Arab Emirates on layovers as well.

## Interests

### Video Games

I enjoy playing video games even though I am objectively terrible at them (someone once said to me, "I never seen someone so bad at video games before--I didn't know it was possible..."). My proudest accomplishment has been sucessfully mapping my Logitech Driving Force GT racing wheel to Goat Simulator controls so I could drive the goat. My all-time favourite video games include Persona 4 Golden, GRID Autosport, Mario Kart 7, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Pok√©mon Ruby, Tetris, Slime Rancher and osu!.

### Cycling

Although I've largely become a bum since retiring from short track, I still enjoy going on the occasional ride with friends on my road bike. I hope that I can muster the motivation to do it more often. [[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/5494530)]
