## Skills
Majority of the classes I took in my undergraduate degree were conducted in either Java or C/C++, while my postgraduate modules were taught primarily in Python. I have worked on academic assignments and projects that involved building machine learning models with TensorFlow and PyTorch, including my Capstone design project. I also have a practical understanding of front-end web development using ReactJS, and game development using Unity and C# from collaborative term projects. 

During the summer of 2021, I worked a summer student position at Flexcim Services Inc., a small manufacturing company that specialises in injection moulding and CNC machining. I gained experience writing software in Python to manage MySQL databases and programming PLCs using ladder logic.

From May 2022 to August 2023, I did a software internship at AMD. I contributed to [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT)/[hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipFFT), an open-source library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms on AMD and NVIDIA GPU devices. I developed skills in GPU programming using C++, as well as prototyping and performance testing using Python.

In November 2024, I started a research internship with the [Biocomputing and Developmental Systems](https://bds.ul.ie) Group in [Lero](https://lero.ie) to research the application of Grammatical Evolution in evolving machine learning models as GPU programs, with a focus on the evolution of NVIDIA CUDA kernels in C.

## Travel

Since emigrating from Singapore to Canada in 2003, I have been to six provinces across the country (Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan). I have also been able to return to Singapore fairly frequently over the years. In 2024, I moved to Ireland to undertake postgraduate studies.

In total, I have set foot in 33 countries over five continents. I've visited Australia, Austria, The Bahamas, Belgium, Belize, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, France, Greece, the Holy See (Vatican), Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I have passed through Germany, the ROC (Taiwan), and the United Arab Emirates on layovers as well.

## Interests

My all-time favourite video games include *Persona 4 Golden*, *Overwatch 2*, *GRID Autosport*, *Mario Kart 7*, *Super Smash Bros. Melee*, *Pokémon Ruby*, *Tetris*, *KeyWe*, *PlateUp!* and *A Little to the Left*.

### Photography

![Toy Camera](/assets/images/toycamera.jpg)

My photography journey began in 2007, when I received a pink toy camera from my godmother for Christmas. Not long after receiving it, I dropped it and broke it. Sadly, this will not be the last camera of mine to suffer this cruel fate.

A few years later, I bought a black Sony Cyber-shot camera from the local Walmart. It was the first major  purchase (over CA$100!) I'd ever made. Unfortunately, it fell off my lap and smashed against a tile floor during a family vacation to Florida, USA in 2011.

Shortly after this, my dad got me an updated Sony Cyber-shot camera as a Christmas gift. The death of this camera was the most theatrical and tragic of all. It was a rainy day in New York City, USA. I was exploring the city with my brother, dad, and uncle. We were walking through Times Square when I saw a massive puddle. Naturally, I had the urge to jump over it. As I was jumping, the camera fell out of my pocket and into the puddle. I grabbed it out as quickly as I could, but it was too late. Slowly, the water seeped through its components. It took its last photograph in the American Museum of Natural History before drawing its last breath in my clumsy arms.

Despite my terrible track record, my passion for photography never died. These days, I shoot with a Olympus E-PL3 micro four-thirds digital camera and an Olympus OM-1n film camera. I love using them to capture memories of different people, places, and things. Thankfully, both these cameras have survived to this day.

### Bouldering

I started indoor bouldering recently and I've been enjoying it a lot. It's been an awesome way to hang out with friends and get off my sedentary butt. I love crimps and hate slopers.
